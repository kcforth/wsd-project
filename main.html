		<p>We all know how hard it can be to prepare tasty and 
		easy meals in the current world we live in.  Dual income 
		families, busy kids and unexpected things keep us in the
		drive-thru lanes of convenience food and out of the 
		kitchen.  Since we all know fresh preparation is healthier,
		this site is intended to give people a way to eat more
		conscientiously while still being easy and not breaking
		the bank.</p>
		
		<p>We've spent many hours of research and experimentation,
		not to mention many taste tests, to bring you recipes that
		are sure to please the pickiest eater while getting you out
		of the kitchen fast and on with your life.  This site by no
		means represents all of the different cuisines or diets but
		we've tried to gather the best <strong>representation</strong> 
		of the various cooking styles across the US.  <span>We will 
		continue to work to bring you the best dishes and will 
		include the newest and best in further publications.</span> In the 
		meantime, let's jump right in with our first recipe!</p>
